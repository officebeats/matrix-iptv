# Why use a Terminal App?

Modern web browsers are massive, resource-heavy environments that serve as the primary gateway for data collection. Most "Modern" IPTV web apps are built on top of browsers, bringing with them a tail of trackers, cookies, and unnecessary bloat.

### 🚀 The Speed Factor

In a TUI (Text User Interface), there are no images to decode for the interface, no layout engines to compute complex CSS, and no garbage collection pauses from 50MB of JavaScript.

- **Instant Boot**: From terminal to TV in under 2 seconds.
- **Low Latency**: Every microsecond saved in UI rendering is a microsecond faster you get to your content.
- **Low Overhead**: Uses less than 1% of the RAM required by a modern Chrome tab.

### 🛡️ Absolute Privacy

When you use a browser-based player, your viewing habits are exposed to the browser's telemetry. This app communicates **only** with your chosen IPTV provider. Period.

- **No Cookies**: We don't track your state.
- **No Analytics**: Your data stays on your machine.
- **Encrypted Streams**: We support SSL/TLS out of the box for secure playlist fetching.

### ⚡ Keyboard Philosophy

The Matrix wasn't built for a mouse. Once you master the keyboard shortcuts:

- `j`/`k` for lightning-fast scrolling.
- `/` for instant fuzzy searching across 10,000+ channels.
- `Tab` to jump between categories and streams.

_You don't just use the app; you inhabit it._

# Why use a Terminal App?
Modern web apps are often bloated, slow, and full of trackers. TUI (Text User Interface) apps like this are designed for **Speed** and **Privacy**.
*   **🚀 Instant**: Runs on any PC, old or new. No loading bars.
*   **🛡️ Private**: No ads, no tracking scripts, no browser bloat.
*   **⚡ Efficient**: Once you learn the keyboard shortcuts (like `j`/`k` to move), you can navigate faster than using a mouse.

# Why use a Terminal App?

Modern web apps are often bloated, slow, and full of trackers. TUI (Text User Interface) apps like this are designed for **Speed** and **Privacy**.

### Core Advantages

- 🚀 **Instant**: Runs on any PC, old or new. No loading bars.
- 🛡️ **Private**: No ads, no tracking scripts, no browser bloat.
- ⚡ **Efficient**: Once you learn the keyboard shortcuts (like `j`/`k` to move), you can navigate faster than using a mouse.

### Keyboard Philosophy

In the Matrix, speed is everything. We prioritize keyboard-driven navigation to keep you in the flow.

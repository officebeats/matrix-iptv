# What is IPTV?

IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) lets you stream live TV channels and movies over your internet connection, instead of using traditional cable or satellite.

### Why is it superior?

- 📺 **One App Rule**: Instead of juggling 10 different streaming apps, all your content is in **one place** with one familiar layout.
- 🚫 **No Popups**: Unlike sketchy streaming sites that bombard you with risky ads, specialized IPTV players are clean and ad-free.
- 💎 **Professional Quality**: You get real broadcast signals, often in higher bitrate than web players, with minimal buffering.

### Device Freedom

Use **Xtream Codes** to login on almost any device:

- 📱 **Mobile**: Android, iOS
- 💻 **PC**: Windows, Linux, Mac (using players like this one!)
- 📺 **TV**: Android TV, FireStick, Apple TV

As long as you have a compatible client, your one subscription works everywhere.

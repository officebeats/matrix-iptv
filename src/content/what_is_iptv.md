# What is IPTV?

IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) refers to the delivery of television content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Unlike traditional broadcast, satellite, or cable formats, IPTV offers the ability to stream source media continuously.

### 🧠 How it Works

Instead of receiving signals via an antenna or coaxial cable, your device requests "packets" of video data over your internet connection. This allows for:

- **Bi-directional communication**: The server knows what you are watching and can provide better quality/buffering management.
- **On-Demand Access**: VOD (Video on Demand) is built into the protocol, allowing you to watch movies and series anytime.
- **Global Reach**: You can watch a channel from Tokyo as easily as one from your local city.

### 💎 Why it's the "Red Pill" of Media

The traditional media landscape is fragmented. You pay for 5 different subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, HBO, ESPN, etc.) and still don't have everything.

IPTV consolidates these signals into **one unified stream**.

- **Live Sports**: Access every game, from every league, in every country.
- **PPV Events**: Most providers include PPV events (Boxing, UFC) at no extra cost.
- **Local News**: Stay connected to your home city, regardless of where you are in the world.

### ⚡ The Connection

For the best experience, we recommend a wired (Ethernet) connection. While 25Mbps is enough for 4K streaming, the stability of your connection matters more than the raw speed.

# What is IPTV? (Internet Protocol Television)
IPTV lets you stream live TV channels and movies over your internet connection, instead of using traditional cable or satellite complications.

### Why is it better than Apps & Sites?
*   **One App Rule**: Instead of juggling 10 different streaming apps, all your content is in ONE place with ONE familiar layout.
*   **No Popups**: Unlike "free streaming sites" that bombard you with risky ads and malware, IPTV players are clean, safe, and ad-free.
*   **Professional Quality**: You get real broadcast signals, often in higher bitrate than web players, without buffering or tracking.

### Why choose IPTV?
*   **Reliability**: Digital streaming doesn't suffer from bad weather signal loss like satellite dishes.
*   **Flexibility**: Watch exactly what you want, from any country.
*   **Freedom**: Use **Xtream Codes** to login on ANY device.
    *   📱 **Mobile**: Android, iOS
    *   💻 **PC**: Windows, Linux, Mac (using players like this one!)
    *   📺 **TV**: Android TV, FireStick, Apple TV

As long as you have a compatible player client, your one subscription works everywhere.

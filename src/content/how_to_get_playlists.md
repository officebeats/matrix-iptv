# How do I get a playlist?

Matrix IPTV is a **player**, not a service provider. We provide the vessel; you provide the fuel. To watch content, you need an IPTV subscription from a third-party provider.

### 🛡️ Where to Buy Safely

We strongly advise against buying from "random" websites indexed on Google. Most are fly-by-night operations that will disappear with your money. Instead, use established digital marketplaces where sellers have ratings and buyer protection.

- **Marketplaces**: **G2G.com**, **Z2U.com**, or **Eldorado.gg**.
- **Search Terms**: "IPTV Subscription", "Xtream Codes", or "M3U Playlist".

### 🦖 Recommended Providers (The Big Three)

While we are not affiliated with these, they are the "standard" in the industry:

1. **Strong8k**: Known for the highest bitrate 4K streams. If you have a high-end display and fast internet, this is the premium choice. Best for live sports.
2. **Trex**: The largest VOD (Movies & Series) library in the world. Extremely reliable server infrastructure but can have "bloated" channel lists.
3. **Mega / 4kOTT**: Great budget-friendly options. They offer a huge variety of global channels but may experience more downtime during massive sporting events.

### 🔑 Connecting via Xtream Codes

When you buy a subscription, the provider will send you three pieces of information:

- **Server URL**: (e.g., `http://server.link:8080`)
- **Username**: (e.g., `matrix_user`)
- **Password**: (e.g., `redpill123`)

In this app, press `n` on the Home screen to enter these credentials. Once saved, they are encrypted locally on your machine.

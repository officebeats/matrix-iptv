# How do I get a playlist to view content?

This app is a player. You need a **Playlist** to watch TV.

Flexible IPTV playlists are sold by third-party providers. We recommend buying from safe marketplaces rather than sketchy sites.

### Recommended Steps

1. **Visit a Marketplace**
   Go to **g2g.com** or **z2u.com** (these are like eBay for digital goods).

2. **Search for a Provider**

- 💪 **Strong8k**: Premium quality, 4K/8K streams. (Higher price, less bloat)
- 🦖 **Trex**: Reliable standard, massive VOD library. (Medium price)
- ⚡ **Mega**: Budget-friendly option. (Lowest price, more junk channels)

_Note: Higher prices usually mean better stability and cleaner channel lists._

3. **Pay Safely**
   Use **Google Pay** or **Apple Pay** on these marketplaces to protect your info.

4. **Connect (Xtream Codes)**
   You will receive a **URL**, **Username**, and **Password**.
   These three items are known as **Xtream Codes**.

Press `n` on the Home screen to enter them and start watching.

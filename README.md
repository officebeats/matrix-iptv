**// THE_PREMIUM_TERMINAL_IPTV_DECODER //**

Matrix IPTV CLI is a blazing fast, keyboard-driven interface for browsing Live TV, Movies, and Series. Inspired by the Matrix and built with Rust, it's designed to be the ultimate premium TUI (Terminal User Interface) for IPTV power users.

This project is being actively optimized by **Ernesto "Beats"** with a primary focus on **Live TV and Sports** performance, ensuring zero-latency navigation and professional-grade video clarity.

## 📽️ MPV Enhancements

We leverage advanced **MPV** flags to ensure professional-level video quality even on lower-end hardware:

- **Fullscreen Mode**: Launches directly into fullscreen (`--fs`) for a professional, TV-like experience.
- **On Screen Controller**: Enables `--osc=yes` for usability and control.
- **Advanced Anti-Aliasing**: Uses `spline36` scaling, providing superior edge smoothing.

## ⚙️ Advanced Features

Matrix IPTV CLI provides several core utilities to manage complex setups safely:

- **VLC Fallback Integration**: While MPV provides the ultimate playback tier, you can configure the app to fall back to launching VLC Media Player instead, maximizing compatibility.
- **Dynamic Background Sync**: Automatically handles large playlist parsing without hanging the UI, providing fluid progress updates and ETAs while it indexes tens of thousands of channels.
